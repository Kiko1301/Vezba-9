To ensure the seamless functionality of the database, a meticulous system was implemented to manage and increment employee IDs as new records were added. This approach guarantees the systematic and unique identification of each employee within the database.

The process involves a structured mechanism that, upon the addition of new employee records, automatically assigns a distinct and incremented employee ID. This not only serves as a primary key for individual records but also facilitates efficient data organization and retrieval.

By implementing this system, the database is now equipped to systematically and accurately manage employee information, providing a robust foundation for various operations within the application. The automated incrementation of employee IDs ensures that each record is uniquely identified, contributing to the overall integrity and functionality of the database.
